## Sizing elements

### Containers
As certain elements grow based on aspect ratio and we want to limit the size it can grow to for larger screens, we set a max width. There are a few containers we use for this:

- `.w-full`: full width for background colors and sticky elements like the header
- `.container`: max width for visual elements
- `.container-content`: max width and horizontal padding for content, see `tailwind.containers.js` for variations

The container paddings are responsive values based on css variables, you can use the associated Tailwind spacings for absolute positioned elements (see `tailwind.config.js` ‚Üí `theme.extend.spacings`).
